the Healthcare Electronic Health Records (EHR) System
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Healthcare Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. The goal of this system is to store, retrieve, and manage digital patient health records. The EHR system is intended to enhance operational efficiency and improve patient care by automating key tasks such as patient registration, medical history tracking, and billing.
1. Introduction
Purpose
This SRS is created to provide clear, well-defined specifications for developing an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The primary aim is to improve the way patient data is managed within the healthcare organization, streamline administrative processes, and ensure the system is fully compliant with industry standards.
Scope
The EHR system will include features such as:
    • Patient Registration: Storing and managing new patient data.
    • Medical History Tracking: Keeping up-to-date records of patients' medical histories.
    • Billing & Insurance Claims: Automating the creation of invoices and the processing of insurance claims.
    • The system will not handle things like drug prescriptions or communication with external healthcare organizations.
Definitions and Acronyms
    • EHR: Electronic Health Records
    • UI: User Interface
    • API: Application Programming Interface
    • HIPAA: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
References
    • IEEE 830-1998: Standard for Software Requirements Specification
    • HIPAA compliance guidelines
    • ISO 9001 for quality management standards

This document defines the system's requirements, providing both functional and non-functional specifications, including user requirements and design constraints. The goal is to ensure the system is practical, easy to use, secure, and scalable.
2. Overall Description
Product Perspective
The EHR system will be a key component of the healthcare organization’s software infrastructure. It will work closely with other systems, such as scheduling and billing software, to provide a unified solution for managing patient records.
Product Functions
    • Patient Registration: The system will allow healthcare providers to capture and manage basic patient information.
    • Medical History: Healthcare providers can store and update patient medical records.
    • Billing & Insurance: The system will automate billing, process insurance claims, and handle payments.
User Characteristics
    • Healthcare Providers: Doctors, nurses, and administrative staff will use the system daily. They will need a simple but effective way to interact with patient records.
    • Patients: Patients may access some parts of the system (e.g., for appointment scheduling) but won’t interact directly with medical data.
    • Administrators: IT staff will be responsible for maintaining the system and ensuring it runs smoothly.
Constraints
    • The system must comply with HIPAA regulations for data privacy and security.
    • The system should be compatible with modern web browsers and mobile devices.
    • All sensitive patient data must be encrypted both in transit and while stored.
Assumptions and Dependencies
    • The system assumes that the healthcare organization has a stable internet connection and necessary hardware (computers, tablets).
    • The system will rely on third-party billing systems for insurance claim processing.
3. Specific Requirements
Functional Requirements
    1. Patient Registration: The system should allow authorized users to register new patients by capturing basic information such as name, birthdate, contact information, and medical history.
    2. Medical History Tracking: The system must allow healthcare providers to input, update, and retrieve a patient’s medical records during visits. It must ensure data privacy and comply with HIPAA regulations.
    3. Billing & Insurance Claims: The system must automatically generate invoices for patient treatments. It should also be able to submit claims to insurance companies based on the treatment records.
External Interface Requirements
    • User Interface (UI): The system should provide a user-friendly interface for both healthcare providers and patients.
    • Hardware Interface: The system should run on computers and tablets available in healthcare settings.
    • Software Interface: The system will need to interface with third-party systems for billing and insurance claims.
Performance Requirements
    • The system should support at least 100 concurrent users at a time.
    • The response time for any user action should be under two seconds.
Database Requirements
    • The system will use a relational database to store patient data and logs.
    • The system should back up patient data every 24 hours.
Design Constraints
    • The system must be designed to comply with HIPAA for security and privacy.
    • It should be modular, allowing for future features like medication management.
System Attributes
    • Security: All sensitive data, including patient health records, must be encrypted. Access to this data should be controlled through role-based access.
    • Availability: The system must be available 24/7, with minimal downtime.
    • Maintainability: The system should be easy to update and maintain with clear documentation for each module.
4. Appendices
Glossary of Terms
    • Patient Record: A comprehensive digital record of a patient's medical history, treatments, and personal information.
    • Billing Information: Financial records related to the patient’s treatments and insurance claims.

    • Use Case Diagrams: Diagrams showing how users (like healthcare providers or patients) interact with the system.

Version Control :
Version control for the Healthcare Electronic Health Records (EHR) system will be managed using Git, a distributed version control system. This will ensure efficient collaboration among developers, track changes to the system’s source code, and maintain a clear history of updates. The system will follow a branching strategy with distinct branches for development, features, and bug fixes, and each change will be documented with detailed commit messages. Version tagging will help track major releases, and pull requests will allow for collaborative review before merging changes. Continuous Integration (CI) will automatically test updates, ensuring code quality and minimizing errors.
